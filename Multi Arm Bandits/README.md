 Multi Arm Bandits deals with the problem of choosing an k different actions and receiving a numerical reward from a stationary probability distribution.
I have set the said reward to be an integer between -10 and +10, and the value of epsilon can be changed according to whatever we wish to. I have experimented with values 0.001, 0.1, 0.5 and 1. I have averaged these over 2000 runs, and plotted the average performance of the graph over these runs.
